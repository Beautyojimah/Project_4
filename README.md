# Predictive Analysis for Future Product Sales (Project_4)

## Overview

In the competitive business landscape, accurate sales forecasting is pivotal for strategic planning in the retail industry. This project aims to develop a predictive analytics model to forecast future product sales leveraging historical data, store characteristics, and external factors. Within this repository are the various jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development and database creation. 

The database was used to hold the data that was used for building the interactive web visualisation. It also contains the reduced dataset that was used for the prediction. Also the repository contains the Flask application script `app.py`, which was used for the backend. Additionally, the repository contains prophet model predictions for 5 stores with ID (4, 219, 676,1066, 1098), saved in pickle `pkl`.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model for accurate sales forecasting.
- Analyze the influence of various factors on sales.
- Create a user-friendly web application for visualization.
- Integrate with a database system for real-time analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and normalization using Python Pandas.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis to understand data trends, patterns, and relationships. Visualizations created using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

- **Feature Engineering**: Identification and engineering of relevant features to improve model performance.

- **Model Development**: Experimentation with various regression and time-series models using Scikit-learn.

- **Interactive Visualization**: A web application developed using HTML/CSS and plotly to showcase predicted sales and insights.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- Data Analysis: Python Pandas
- Visualization: Python Matplotlib, JavaScript Plotly
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Database: SQLite Database
